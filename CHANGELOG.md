### 0.2.1 - Theorem Proving in Lean4

Formal verification requires describing hardware and software systems in mathematical terms, at which point establishing claims as to their correctness becomes a form of theorem proving.
* added docs explaining theorem proving in Lean4.

### 0.1.1 - QOL and program structure

* Learned to use `#eval` in Lean4.
* found a repository with code directly matching my use case, copied and looked at differences between different ways of copying boilerplate code.
* lakefile can be .toml or .lean, and its unclear which is preferred.

### 0.1.0 - Initial Setup and Lean Language Installation

* Set up Lean language on the system, encountering two errors which are documented in GitHub issue #1.
* Learned to repeat a command sequence in Vim.
* Initial thoughts on using Lean to create a model of a tokenomic system, exploring connections between personal value systems, ethical frameworks, and collective value systems.
* Explored the idea of modeling institutions as smart contracts and transactions, and what it means for a governance system to be inclusive.
* Identified the need to explore Cardano's transaction model (eUTXO) and its relationship to tokenomics.
